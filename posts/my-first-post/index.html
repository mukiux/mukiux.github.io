<p>I‚Äôm George Kiio, an Information Security and Data Analysis expert with over 8 years of experience navigating the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape. I‚Äôve built my career leading Security Operations Center (SOC) teams, orchestrating threat detection, incident response, and digital forensics‚Äîall while ensuring systems remain resilient against sophisticated cyber threats. My journey has been defined by an unwavering passion for protecting organizations and empowering teams to tackle the toughest security challenges head-on.</p>
<p>With a solid academic foundation‚Äîa Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from the University of Nairobi‚Äîand a suite of global certifications including CEH, CHFI, CSX-F, AWS, and CCISO, I‚Äôve honed a unique blend of analytical thinking, leadership, and technical expertise. From managing complex SOC environments to mentoring junior analysts, I‚Äôm driven by a commitment to not only detect threats but to anticipate and neutralize them proactively.</p>
<p>But beyond the code and the consoles, I‚Äôm a people-centric leader. I believe cybersecurity is more than just a set of tools; it‚Äôs a culture, a mindset, and a shared responsibility. I thrive on building relationships with clients, mentoring upcoming talent, and fostering collaboration across teams to ensure that everyone plays a part in defending the digital frontier.</p>
<p>When I‚Äôm not in the trenches with my team, you‚Äôll find me exploring new technologies, crafting innovative solutions, and advocating for continuous learning. Cybersecurity is an ever-evolving field, and I‚Äôm here for the long haul‚Äîcommitted, energetic, and always ready to adapt and grow.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs connect, share ideas, and create a safer digital world‚Äîone step at a time. üåçüîí</p>
